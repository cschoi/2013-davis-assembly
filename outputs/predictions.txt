Predictions
===========

It is hard to predict things, especially the future.
 - Niels Bohr

Predictions:

 - @ryneches: by Dec 31, 2015, Illumina reads will be longer than
   Sanger reads ever were. (> 1kb)
 - @arturgreensward: by Dec 31, 2015, PacBio will be the only thing
   used to sequence bacterial genomes
 - @pathogenomenick: by Dec 31, 2014, there will be two Nanopore
   platforms usefully available
 - OH: by Dec 31, 2013, Mick will ask for an embargo
   on new assemblers
 - @lexnederbragt: 2014-2015, diploid aware assemblers will emerge
 - @pathogenomenick: by end of 2015, graph based variant calling will
   be default
 - @ryneches: by 2016, computation will be considerably more expensive
   than sequencing
 - @ctitusbrown: by 2016, the field will have solved the expensive
   computation problem and > 50% of non-biomedical computational
   analysis will be a commodity service (although it may not be
   a particularly good commodity service)
