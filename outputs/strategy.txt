Thoughts on sequencing strategy
===============================

Lex Nederbragt (corr) et al.

When setting up a strategy for sequencing/assembly these are valuable to know:

* the goal of the project, e.g.
 - gene-mining
 - presence/absence of genes
 - long scaffolds for synteny
 - reference genome-standard (whatever that is)
 - strain variation/haplotying
* genome size
* genome complexity, i.e. repeat content and level of heterozygosity
* number of chromosomes, extrachromosomal elements
* can a pure sample be obtained or will there be contaminating DNA?
* how much DNA can be obtained from a single individual/clonal line or will it be necessary to use DNA from a mix of different individuals (read: different genomes)?
* is there sequencing data available from the same individual or species?
* how close is the most closely related reference genome?
