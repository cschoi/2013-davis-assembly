Genome binning with CONCOCT
---------------------------

CONCOCT is automated genome binning software that can use coverage information across multiple samples, composition and paired-end linkage information.

The manuscript describing the software is available on arXiv:

   CONCOCT: Clustering cONtigs on COverage and ComposiTion
   http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.4038

The Github repository is here:

The basic steps are as follows:

-  Generate a co-assembly from all the reads in your dataset (or a subset if too large)
-  Map reads back on a per-sample basis to the contigs to generate coverage information
-  Run CONCOCT to produce clusters
-  (optionally) Link clusters with paired-end reads
-  Evaluate results, e.g. using taxonomic assignments of contigs and presence of conserved genes in clusters
