Questions asked by the attendees
================================

General/unclassified
--------------------

Identify correct next gen sequencing platform!

How do I assemble, call for SNPs, compare genetic elements?

Guided vs Mapped vs Denovo assemblies

Can you salvage a run without enough data?

Compare m/f expression levels in D. suzuki.

Should assembly workflows for complex metagenomes with a large
fraction of eukaryotes use metagenome tools or euk tools? Or, perhaps
which steps in a workflow for complex metagenomes with a large
fraction of eukaryotes should use euk tools and which steps should use
metagenomic tools?

What and how much should cores support? Standard protocols, basic software
install, hands on consultation, ???

Technology choice
-----------------

At what read length should we be moving towards OLC assemblers 
instead of De Bruijn?
 - no obvious answer; further investigation needed
 - 500-1kb probably (JTS)

What are the best tools (assemblers) and workflows for Eukaryote
assemblies? Do they differ according to predicted genome size (80Mb
nematodes vs. 1GB euk)
 - see table

How different are the workflows aimed at metagenome (gene contigs)
vs. whole-genome assembly?
 - different assemblers may be useful; scale may be different; in table.
 - note that contamination is increasingly endemic
 - tools before and after assembly are very similar

Develop scalable, cloud based data analysis and visualization pipeline
 - sorta, khmer-protocols etc.
 - visualization is still lacking although igv, ray browser

Metagenomes and other mixtures
------------------------------

How to deal with "mixed assemblies" (e.g. an endosymbiont). Better 
to filter reads or contigs? Does presence of other sequences 
compromise assembly?
 - blobology shows you the problems
 - different coverage levels may mislead single-genome assemblers
 - better to filter contigs because of specificity, if you get the
   contigs :)
 - if lots of contamination, spades/diginorm/binning/etc. may be
   useful

How to assemble genomes from "messy" samples (non-clean tissue,
data more like a metagenome)?  How can we separate out potential
symbionts and/or secondarily abundant microbes?
 - see above

How does metagenomic assembly not collapse information from 
homologs between strains/species?
 - very situation/data specific

What can one expect to find based on coverage depth?
 - preqc (and eventually khmer) may help diagnose low coverage, 
     high errors
 - argument mihai pop (cite?) about doing a little exploratory
   sequencing then designing next round of libraries based on
   repeat content

How to deal with contamination?
 - see above.
 - concoct etc.
 - kitomics; is there a simple way to remove kit fingerprint? (no.)
 - this is a need.
 - do your negative controls thoroughly, folk

Remove endosymbiont (i.e. Wolbachia) reads from fly and butterfly
data.
 - see above. no standard protocol.

From shotgun data:
- alpha-diversity
  * phylosift or other??
- beta-diversity
  * phylosift or other
- Key taxa at multiple taxonomic levels
  * phylosift or other
- Functional genes for a variety of pathways
  * phylosift cures all (WebMGA is also good)
  * MG-rAST pretends
  * HUMANn

Genome assembly
---------------

How closely related are my insects?
 - probably, very.  This is really a genotyping question...?
 - can do with k-mer distributions (JTS?)
 - but this is complicated and not necessarily easy

Will inbreeding be useful or necessary?
 - useful, but not necessary (just more $$ sequencing)

Seq indiv to chromosomes or at least meaningful 
synteny maps? (inversions)
 - see table of sequencing approaches;
 - optical maps, linkage maps, PacBio

- How to assemble Eukaryotes??
 * see table
- Hybrid needed? What prep? 
 * see table
- WGA for MP lib OK?
 * try to avoid
- Make references? (Should we make strain/haplotype-specific references)
 * "ancestral graph reconstruction" theory
 * tools needed to make a reference graph
- Iteratively improve reference genome with new sequences?
 * can be done; no strong recommendation.  Depends on the sequence
   data you have.  (PBJelly with PacBio, GAA for merging assemblies,
   etc.) Talk to Titus because he has funding to do this on chicken.
- Make pop specific "type" refs?
 * see above, 'make references'
- What exactly is "finishing"
 * No one wanted to answer, no one does it.
 * No such thing as a "finished" genome
- Bias when doing mapping vs de novo?
 * There is allele-specific mapping bias.  (For RNAseq, Wittkopp
   reference)

Assembly outcomes, metrics & evaluation
---------------------------------------

Do we care about the difference between a 150 contig and a 100
contig assembly? What about 10 or 1000 contigs?
 - depends on your question
 - will be limited by your data, requires careful planning; see
   15-17 commandments

- How large is the genome?
 * preqc can tell you this, khmer can estimate badly
- What do I need to do to improve genome quality?
 * more or less the topic of this entire workshop

Can we still use bad quality data?
 * all data is bad quality data, so, yes
 * limits your conclusions.  It's called Science, folks.
 * if data is randomly bad, OK; if it's unknown systematic error, then more is worse.

Quality/completion metrics.
 * see "finishing", above.
 * reads mapped back; marker genes; cegma; reapr; frcbam; visual
   inspection; bridgemapper

What quality genome can I expect?
 * preqc can help tell you this; don't do wheat, soil, or fish.

What's a good way to evaluate completeness?
 - Mapping of reads.  High percentage is good, and tells you if there
   is room for improvement.
 - "treat your assembly as a hypothesis and see how well your reads
   match"
 - bring in orthogonal evidence (see Lex's list)

Sample prep
-----------

How really bad is Nextera (insertion bias and dual 
mode insert size) compared to TruSeq?
 * you just need to be aware that Nextera is messy in different ways
 * we want Nick to write a blog post

How much is it worth striving for PCR-free library preps to avoid 
amplification bias? and/or single-molecule sequencing?
 *
