Questions asked by the attendees
================================

General/unclassified
--------------------

Identify correct next gen sequencing platform!

How do I assemble, call for SNPs, compare genetic elements?

Guided vs Mapped vs Denovo assemblies

Can you salvage a run without enough data?

Compare m/f expression levels in D. suzuki.

Should assembly workflows for complex metagenomes with a large
fraction of eukaryotes use metagenome tools or euk tools? Or, perhaps
which steps in a workflow for complex metagenomes with a large
fraction of eukaryotes should use euk tools and which steps should use
metagenomic tools?

What and how much should cores support? Standard protocols, basic software
install, hands on consultation, ???

Technology choice
-----------------

At what read length should we be moving towards OLC assemblers 
instead of De Bruijn?

What are the best tools (assemblers) and workflows for Eukaryote
assemblies? Do they differ according to predicted genome size (80Mb
nematodes vs. 1GB euk)

How different are the workflows aimed at metagenome (gene contigs)
vs. whole-genome assembly?

Develop scalable, cloud based data analysis and visualization pipeline

Metagenomes and other mixtures
------------------------------

How to deal with "mixed assemblies" (e.g. an endosymbiont). Better 
to filter reads or contigs? Does presence of other sequences 
compromise assembly?

How to assemble genomes from "messy" samples (non-clean tissue,
data more like a metagenome)?  How can we separate out potential
symbionts and/or secondarily abundant microbes?

How does metagenomic assembly not collapse information from 
homologs between strains/species?

What can one expect to find based on coverage depth?

How to deal with contamination?

Remove endosymbiont (i.e. Wolbachia) reads from fly and butterfly
data.

From shotgun data:
- alpha-diversity
- beta-diversity
- Key taxa at multiple taxonomic levels
- Functional genes for a variety of pathways


Genome assembly
---------------

How closely related are my insects?
Will inbreeding be useful or necessary?

Seq indiv to chromosomes or at least meaningful 
synteny maps? (inversions)

- How to assemble Eukaryotes??
- Hybrid needed? What prep? 
- WGA for MP lib OK?
- Make references?
- Iteratively improve ref with new sequences?
- Make pop specific "type" refs?
- What exactly is "finishing"
- Bias when doing mapping vs de novo?

Assembly outcomes, metrics & evaluation
---------------------------------------

Do we care about the difference between a 150 contig and a 100
contig assembly? What about 10 or 1000 contigs?

- How large is the genome?
- What do I need to do to improve genome quality?

Can we still use bad quality data?

Quality/completion metrics.

What quality genome can I expect?

QQ What's a good way to evaluate completeness?
 - Mapping of reads.  High percentage is good, and tells you if there
   is room for improvement.

Sample prep
-----------

How really bad is Nextera (insertion bias and dual 
mode insert size) compared to TruSeq?

How much is it worth striving for PCR-free library preps to avoid 
amplification bias?
