Questions asked by the attendees
================================

How to deal with "mixed assemblies" (e.g. an endosymbiont). Better 
to filter reads or contigs? Does presence of other sequences 
compromise assembly?

Do we care about the difference between a 150 contig and a 100
contig assembly? What about 10 or 1000 contigs?

How does metagenomic assembly not collapse information from 
homologs between strains/species?

How really bad is Nextera (insertion bias and dual 
mode insert size) compared to TruSeq?

How much is it worth striving for PCR-free library preps to avoid 
amplification bias?

At what read length should we be moving towards OLC assemblers 
instead of De Bruijn?

How to assemble genomes from "messy" samples (non-clean tissue,
data more like a metagenome)?  How can we separate out potential
symbionts and/or secondarily abundant microbes?

What are the best tools (assemblers) and workflows for Eukaryote
assemblies? Do they differ according to predicted genome size (80Mb
nematodes vs. 1GB euk)

How different are the workflows aimed at metagenome (gene contigs)
vs. whole-genome assembly?

Identify correct next gen sequencing platform!

Develop scalable, cloud based data analysis and visualization pipeline

Metagenomics - what can one expect to find based on coverage depth?

How should cores be run?  Tradeoff between hands
on/teaching/admin/config/ contracting?

- Guided vs Mapped vs Denovo 
  assemblies
- How to deal with contamination?
- Can you salvage a run without 
  enough data?
- Can we still use bad quality data?
- Quality/completion metrics.

Remove endosymbiont (i.e. Wolbachia) reads from fly and butterfly
data, and assemble genome; compare m/f expression levels in D. suzuki

- alpha-diversity
- beta-diversity
- Key taxa at multiple taxonomic levels
- Functional genes for a variety of pathways

- How large is the genome?
- How closely related are my insects?
- What quality genome can I expect?
- What do I need to do to improve genome quality?
- Will inbreeding be useful or necessary?

- How to assemble, call for SNPs, compare genetic  elements.
- How to assemble Eukaryotes??

Seq indiv to chromosomes or at least meaningful 
synteny maps? (inversions)

- Hybrid needed? What prep? 
- WGA for MP lib OK?
- Make references?
- Iteratively improve ref with new sequences?
- Make pop specific "type" refs?
- What exactly is "finishing"
- Bias when doing mapping vs de novo?
