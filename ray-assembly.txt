Metagenomics Practical
======================

Metagenomics assemblies with Ray
--------------------------------

Ray is a particularly interesting genome assembler due to several
unusual features:

- It can scale to arbitrary numbers of processors and machines by distributing its assembly graph
- It has several functions specific to metagenome assembly 'Ray Meta'
- Ray's author, ``@sebhtml`` is incredibly responsive on Twitter :)
- Ray will happily mix input from several different sequencing techniques, e.g. Illumina and 454
- If run with the ``write-kmers`` option enabled, the resulting assembly graph may be viewed using the separate Ray Cloud Browser software

Installing Ray
--------------

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    sudo apt-get install build-essential
    sudo apt-get install git
    sudo apt-get install openmpi1.6-bin openmpi1.6-common libopenmpi1.6-dev

Installing Ray from source code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    git clone https://github.com/sebhtml/ray
    git clone https://github.com/sebhtml/RayPlatform

    cd ray
    HAVE_LIBZ=y MAXKMERLENGTH=64 make

You can add this to your PATH:

::

    export PATH=$PATH:`pwd`

A simple command-line for multi-processor execution:

For paired-end reads:

::

    mpirun -np 8 Ray -k 31 -p pair1.fastq.gz pair2.fastq.gz -o output_directory

For interleaved paired-end reads:

::

    mpirun -np 8 Ray -k 31 -i pairs.fastq.gz -o output_directory

For single-end reads:

::

    mpirun -np 8 Ray -k 31 -s reads.fastq.gz -o output_directory

If you want to run Ray Cloud Browser, you will want the ``-write-kmers``
option:

::

    mpirun -np 8 Ray -write-kmers -k 31 -p pair1.fastq.gz pair2.fastq.gz -o output directory

If you run via a cluster, i.e. StarCluster, mpirun can be set to execute
on multiple machines, e.g.:

::

    mpirun -np 8 -H host1,host2,host3,host4 -k 31 -p pair1.fastq.gz pair2.fastq.gz -o x
